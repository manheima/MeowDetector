# Meow Detector

Welcome to the Meow Detector project!  
This project uses the **Coral Dev Board Micro** to detect when my cat meows â€” and then plays a calming voice recording to soothe him.

It uses:
- **TensorFlow Lite** to run a custom audio classification model on the **Edge TPU**
- The boardâ€™s **built-in speaker** for audio playback
- The **green User LED** to indicate when a meow is detected
